# About Me

## Background

I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology and Social Intervention at New York University (2019-2024), with a specialty area in Data Science for Social Impact under the guidance of [Dr. J. Lawrence Aber](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/j-lawrence-aber). 

My academic journey has taken me across prestigious institutions including the University of Oxford (MPhil in Evidence-based Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation), Harvard University (Ed.M. in Arts in Education), and Tsinghua University (B.Sc. in Psychology).

## Current Role

**Behavioral Scientist at [The Agency Fund](https://www.agency.fund/)** (June 2024 - Present)

I apply behavioral science principles and data-driven approaches to create meaningful social impact. I also work extensively on designing and evlauting AI products in the social sector. For instance, please see my work on:

- [ChatSEL](https://agency-fund.github.io/chatsel-docs/) - An Open-Source AI-powered Teacher Coaching Chatbot for Diverse SEL Programming in Low-Resource Settings

- [A Living Playbook for AI Evaluation in the Social Sector](https://eval.playbook.org.ai/)

## Research Interests

My research focuses on several interconnected areas:

- **AI evaluation for social impact** - Exploring how AI products can be designed, implemented, and evaluated to produce positive social outcomes
- **Social and emotional learning (SEL)** - Understanding how SEL interventions affect students' SEL and academic outcomes
- **Health and education interventions in low-resource contexts** - Developing evidence-based interventions for vulnerable populations in low-resource contexts *(e.g., mothers in rural India; deaf students in Nepal; Syrian refugee children in Lebanon, etc.)*
- **Evidence-based social psychological interventions** - Creating and testing psychologically wise interventions that improve human agency and development

## More about me

I'm also passionate about music - I play cello, saxophone, and guitar, and have performed with orchestras at Harvard, Oxford, and NYU. In 2015, I was named Best Original Singer at Tsinghua University.
