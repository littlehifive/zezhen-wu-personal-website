# Research

## Current Research Areas

My research focuses on developing and evaluating evidence-based interventions that promote positive outcomes for children and adolescents, particularly in challenging contexts. I specialize in using advanced statistical methods and data science techniques to understand complex social phenomena.

### Primary Research Domains

- **AI Evaluation for Social Impact**: Exploring how artificial intelligence can be ethically and effectively applied to create positive social change
- **Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)**: Designing and testing interventions that support students' emotional development and academic success
- **Education in Crisis Contexts**: Developing culturally responsive interventions for children affected by conflict, displacement, and emergency situations
- **Evidence-Based Social Psychological Interventions**: Creating scalable interventions based on psychological theory to improve academic and well-being outcomes

## Current Projects

### Values Affirmation Research
My dissertation research examines the effects of values affirmation interventions on deaf students in Nepal, combining randomized controlled trial methodology with deep cultural understanding. This work demonstrates how brief psychological interventions can reduce stereotype threat and improve academic outcomes.

### Meta-Analytic Research
I conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses to synthesize evidence across multiple studies, helping to identify what works, for whom, and under what conditions. My meta-analysis on values affirmation has been influential in understanding the boundary conditions of this intervention.

### Measurement Development
I develop and validate psychological measures for use with vulnerable populations, including conflict-affected children and adolescents. This work ensures that research tools are culturally appropriate and psychometrically sound.
