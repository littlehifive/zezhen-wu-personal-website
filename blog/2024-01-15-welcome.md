Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I'll share my thoughts on behavioral science, AI evaluation, programming, research methodologies, and life as an academic-turned-industry scientist.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect to find posts across several areas that reflect my interdisciplinary background:

- **Behavioral science insights**: Thoughts on psychology, social interventions, and human behavior
- **AI evaluation and ethics**: Perspectives on evaluating AI systems for social impact
- **Programming and data science**: Code tutorials, R packages, statistical methods, and research tools
- **Research methodologies**: Reflections on experimental design, measurement, and evidence-based practice
- **Random musings**: Personal thoughts, career reflections, music, and life updates

## How I Organize Content

I use tags to organize posts by topic. Here's what each tag covers:

- **`introduction`** - Welcome posts and overviews of new projects or directions
- **`psychology`** - Behavioral science, social psychology, intervention design, and human development
- **`AI`** - Artificial intelligence evaluation, ethics, social impact, and technology assessment  
- **`programming`** - R, Python, statistical computing, data visualization, and software development
- **`research`** - Methodology, experimental design, measurement, meta-analysis, and academic insights
- **`random`** - Personal reflections, music, travel, career thoughts, and miscellaneous topics

Whether you're interested in rigorous research methods, practical programming solutions, or thoughtful AI evaluation, I hope you'll find something valuable here. 

Stay tuned for more content!
