Some reflections on research methodology and best practices I've learned during my academic journey.

## The Importance of Systematic Approaches

Research methodology forms the backbone of any solid academic work. Over the years, I've learned that having a systematic approach not only improves the quality of research but also makes the entire process more manageable.

## Key Principles I Follow

### 1. Start with Clear Questions
Every good research project begins with well-defined questions. I spend considerable time refining my research questions before diving into the actual work.

### 2. Literature Review is Critical
Understanding what has been done before is essential. I maintain organized notes and use reference management tools to keep track of relevant work.

### 3. Reproducibility Matters
Making research reproducible is not just good practiceâ€”it's essential for advancing knowledge. I always document my methods and make code available when possible.

## Tools That Help

- **Reference Management**: Zotero or Mendeley for organizing papers
- **Note-taking**: Obsidian or Notion for connecting ideas
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes in code and documents
- **Writing**: LaTeX for papers, Markdown for notes and documentation

## Conclusion

Good methodology takes time to develop, but the investment pays off in higher quality research and more efficient workflows.
