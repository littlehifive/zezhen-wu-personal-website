Reflecting on my research journey working with refugee and conflict-affected children, and the unique challenges of conducting rigorous behavioral science in humanitarian contexts.

## The Challenge of Research in Crisis Contexts

Working with Syrian refugee children in Lebanon and Nigerian refugees in Niger has taught me that traditional research approaches often fall short in humanitarian settings. The stakes are higher, resources are limited, and ethical considerations become even more complex.

## Key Lessons from the Field

### 1. Cultural Adaptation is Everything
You cannot simply translate instruments and expect them to work. During my work developing the Self-Regulation Assessment-Assessor Report (SRA-AR), we learned that behavioral regulation manifests differently across cultural contexts. What looks like "disruptive behavior" in one culture might be perfectly appropriate social interaction in another.

### 2. Measurement Must Be Practical
In refugee camps and emergency education settings, lengthy assessments are not feasible. We developed brief, skill-targeted social-emotional learning (SEL) activities that could be implemented by teachers with minimal training while still maintaining scientific rigor.

### 3. Local Partnerships Are Essential
Some of our most impactful work came from genuine partnerships with local organizations and communities. The teachers, camp coordinators, and community leaders weren't just research assistants—they were collaborators who shaped our understanding of what would actually work.

## The Values Affirmation Research

My dissertation research on values affirmation with deaf students in Nepal exemplifies how psychological interventions can be adapted for vulnerable populations. This brief writing exercise, where students reflect on their core values, has shown remarkable effects in reducing stereotype threat and improving academic outcomes.

What made this work special wasn't just the statistical significance (though Cohen's d = 0.42 is pretty exciting!), but seeing how a simple intervention could help students see their challenges as manageable rather than indicative of their worth.

## Looking Forward: AI and Social Impact

Now at The Agency Fund, I'm exploring how artificial intelligence can scale these types of evidence-based interventions. The challenge is maintaining the human-centered, culturally responsive approach that makes behavioral science effective while leveraging technology's reach.

## The Real Impact

The numbers matter—effect sizes, confidence intervals, p-values. But what keeps me motivated is remembering the teachers in Lebanon who told us our training helped them better support their students, or the students in Nepal who said the values affirmation exercise helped them feel more confident in school.

That's the intersection where rigorous science meets real-world impact, and it's exactly where I want to keep working.
